			<h1>Upgrading or repairing your synthagen</h1>
			<p>Warning, the following guides require some technical know-how. If you at all unsure about what you are doing, it is very important that you have your synthagen ship itself to an authorized repair agent.

<p>	First, inform your synthagen of exactly what your intentions are. Show them the new part you are intending to replace or install, and explain to them its purpose as best you can. If you’re installing a new mod, it’s a good idea to sell them on the benefits it provides. If they are curious, explain to them how you are going to do the install and show them the tools you intend to use. Your goal is to make them happy to receive the upgrade or repair, and confident in your abilities to perform it. If you have succeeded, then they will go into hibernation mode, essentially shutting off their brain and only leaving a few sensors running. Once a synthagen is hibernating, be sure it isn’t connected to any external devices or plugged in. Then it is safe to perform the needed surgery on your synthagen to repair or upgrade it.</p>
<p>	For limb repairs or upgrades, make a small incision just above where the limb connects to the body, cutting through the skin and the mesh flesh below it, careful to not cut more than absolutely needed. Look for the limb’s small dedicated circuit-board, it can be replaced by cutting the chitin holding it and sliding a new one in its place. The new board may be loosely held for a few hours as the chitin regrows around it so have your synthagen avoid any physical activities. Limb boards also have a small slot on the top to hold a limb module (or two for the tail), which can be installed by sliding the module card inside. Check to make sure the notch is facing the correct direction and press inward until you hear a click. To remove a module, press down on the metal latch on the side and slide it out.</p>
<p>	To repair or replace the LED visor or wifi card, first instruct your synthagen to open its mouth before hibernating. Then cut completely around the face, being sure not to cut the face itself. Cut the mouth where it connects to the visor and lift the visor slowly. This will reveal the synthagen’s head. For wifi card repairs, cut the circulatory system connecting the card and replace it with a new one. For visor repairs, cut out the old visor and slowly place a new one over the synthagen’s face. Allow the synthagen to hibernate for 30 minutes to repair the connections between the visor, mouth, and circulatory system and then plug it in to the wall.</p>
<p>	To replace the digestive system, instruct your synthagen to open its mouth before hibernating. Then make a small vertical cut just below the front part of the neck. Cut the lungs and circulatory system where they connect to the “stomach,” and the “stomach” at the “esophagus”. Pull the entire organ out through the cut you created. Cut the chitin connecting the mouth to the visor display and pull pull the mouth out. Place a new carbon or grain tropic device inside the synthagen through its mouth, stretching the mouth end until it touches the display. The synthagen, on waking up, will automatically reconnect the circulatory system and mouth.</p>
<p>	To replace the batteries or motherboard, make a small vertical cut on the front (anterior) side of the chest, and open it until you see the motherboard or batteries. For the batteries, simply cut the chitin holding them in place and replace them, careful that they are facing the correct direction. For the motherboard, first cut the circulatory system where it connects to the board, then cut the chitin holding it in place, finally slide the old board out and the new one in. Wait 30 minutes for the chitin and circulatory system to heal and then plug in the synthagen to its backup drive and then to the wall. It will automatically recover its memories and then unplug itself.</p>
<p>	In the rare event that the circulatory system completely fails, which almost always happens because of lethal amounts of physical damage, the complete reset operation can be performed. First, make the appropriate cuts to replace anything broken (following the instructions above), then short-circuit jumper pins CM1 and CM3 on the motherboard. Plug in the synthagen while these pins are still shorted, then stop short circuiting them after about 5 seconds. DO NOT KEEP THEM SHORTED, if the pins remain shorted for a minute or more the synthagen will assume it’s a bug or mistake and boot regularly and this may cause heating damage to the motherboard. If done properly the visor display will show a temperature, voltage, and repair status reading and its mouth will gape open. Every few hours, feed it simple cooked grains that have been blended into a paste. After several days the synthagen will be fully rehabilitated and will automatically reboot and recover.</p>
<p>	Every other kind of repair, for example repairing motors in limbs, speakers, skin cuts, damages to the circulatory system, et cetera, is performed automatically by the synthagen.</p>
